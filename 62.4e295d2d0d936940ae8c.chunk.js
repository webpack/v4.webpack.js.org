These typically end up as individual files within the <a href="/glossary/#o">output</a> but can also be inlined via things like the <a href="/loaders/style-loader">style-loader</a> or <a href="/loaders/url-loader">url-loader</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id="b">B<a href="#b" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="/guides/getting-started/#creating-a-bundle"><strong>Bundle</strong></a>: Produced from a number of distinct modules, bundles contain the final versions of source files that have already undergone the loading and compilation process.</li>\n<li><a href="/guides/code-splitting"><strong>Bundle Splitting</strong></a>: This process offers one way of optimizing a build, allowing webpack to generate multiple bundles for a single application. As a result, each bundle can be isolated from changes effecting others, reducing the amount of code that needs to be republished and therefore re-downloaded by the client and taking advantage of browser caching.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id="c">C<a href="#c" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Chunk</strong>: This webpack-specific term is used internally to manage the bundling process. Bundles are composed out of chunks, of which there are several types (e.g. entry and child). Typically, <em>chunks</em> directly correspond with the output <em>bundles</em> however, there are some configurations that don\'t yield a one-to-one relationship.</li>\n<li><a href="/guides/code-splitting/"><strong>Code Splitting</strong></a>: Refers to dividing your code into various bundles/chunks which you can then load on demand instead of loading a single bundle containing everything.</li>\n<li><a href="/concepts/configuration/"><strong>Configuration</strong></a>: webpack config file is a plain old JavaScript file that exports an object. This object is then processed by webpack based upon its defined properties.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id="d">D<a href="#d" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="/concepts/dependency-graph"><strong>Dependency Graph</strong></a>: Any time one file depends on another, webpack treats this as a <em>dependency</em>. Starting from an entry point(s), webpack recursively builds a dependency graph that includes every module/asset your application needs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id="e">E<a href="#e" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="/concepts/entry-points"><strong>Entry Point</strong></a>: The entry point tells webpack where to start and follows the graph of dependencies to know what to bundle. You can think of your application\'s entry point(s) as the <strong>contextual root(s)</strong> of what you want bundled.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id="h">H<a href="#h" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="/concepts/hot-module-replacement"><strong>Hot Module Replacement (HMR)</strong></a>: A process that exchanges, adds, or removes  <code>modules</code> while an application is running without a full page reload.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id="l">L<a href="#l" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="/concepts/loaders"><strong>Loaders</strong></a>: Transformations that are applied on the source code of a module. They allow you to pre-process files as you <code>require()</code> or "load" them. Similar to a \'task-runner\'.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id="m">M<a href="#m" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="/concepts/modules"><strong>Module</strong></a>: Discrete chunks of functionality that provide a smaller surface area than a full program. Well-written modules provide solid abstractions and encapsulation boundaries which make up a coherent design and clear purpose.</li>\n<li><a href="/concepts/module-resolution/"><strong>Module Resolution</strong></a>: A module can be required as a dependency from another module and a resolver is a library which helps in locating a module by its absolute path. Modules are searched for inside all directories specified in <code>resolve.modules</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id="o">O<a href="#o" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href="/concepts/output"><strong>Output</strong></a>: Option(s) specifying where to output the compiled files to disk.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Note, that while there can be multiple entry points, only one output configuration is specified.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id="p">P<a href="#p" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="/concepts/plugins"><strong>Plugin</strong></a>: A JavaScript object that has an <code>apply</code> property. This <code>apply</code> property is called by the webpack compiler, giving access to the entire compilation lifecycle. These packages will typically extend compilation functionality in one way or another.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id="r">R<a href="#r" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="/guides/dependency-management/"><strong>Request</strong></a>: Refers to the expression in the require/import statement, e.g. <em>require("./template/" + name + ".ejs")</em>, the request is <em>"./template/" + name + ".ejs"</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id="t">T<a href="#t" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="/configuration/target/"><strong>Target</strong></a>: User configured deployment target(s) <a href="/configuration/target/">listed here</a> to compile for a specific environment like the browser, NodeJS, or Electron.</li>\n<li><a href="/guides/tree-shaking/"><strong>Tree Shaking</strong></a>: Unused/Excess code elimination, or more precisely, live code importing. Compilers like webpack will accomplish this by analyzing the various kinds <code>import</code> statements and usage of the imported code to determine what parts of dependencies are actually being utilized, dropping parts of the "tree" that are not.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id="v">V<a href="#v" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="/concepts/entry-points/#separate-app-and-vendor-entries"><strong>Vendor Entry Point</strong></a>: Create dependency graphs starting at both <code>app.js</code> and <code>vendors.js</code>. These graphs are completely separate and independent of each other to allow leverage of <code>CommonsChunkPlugin</code> and extract any vendor references from your app bundle into your vendor bundle. Helps achieve a common pattern in webpack known as <a href="/guides/caching/">long-term vendor-caching</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id="w">W<a href="#w" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="/"><strong>webpack</strong></a>: A highly configurable <a href="/concepts/modules">module</a> bundler for modern JavaScript applications.</li>\n</ul>\n'}}]);
